## What This Course Is

A visual introduction to programming using Scratch — a drag-and-drop block language built at MIT. No syntax, no compiler. You build logic by snapping blocks together like puzzle pieces.

This isn't a course about Scratch. It's a course about how programs think. Functions, conditions, loops, variables, events, abstraction — these are the same concepts in Python, Java, C, and every other language. Scratch just makes them visible without the overhead of syntax getting in the way.

Used as the on-ramp to Harvard's CS50x for students with zero programming experience.

## Projects

One project submitted per week, each focused on that week's concept. 9 projects total plus a final project.

Projects included interactive animations (weather displays, scene transitions), if/else branching logic with multiple outcomes, programs that respond to user input and keyboard events, and games with sprite movement, collision detection, and score tracking.

**Requirements for each project:**
- At least 2 sprites (characters/objects in the scene)
- At least 3 scripts
- Use of conditions, loops, and variables
- At least one custom block (Scratch's version of a function)

**My projects included:** Weather display with conditional logic, scene-based stories with branching (If/If-1), interactive animations (Scene1), and free-form explorations (Untitled series).

## What I Learned

**Sprites and scripts** — everything in Scratch is a sprite with its own code. Multiple sprites coordinate through events and messages. This is object-level thinking before you know what objects are.

**Functions (custom blocks)** — you can name a sequence of instructions and call it by that name. This is the core idea behind every function in every language. Once you write `drawSquare` you never think about the individual steps again.

**Events** — programs don't just run top-to-bottom. They wait for triggers: a keypress, a click, a message from another sprite. This is how real software works. Event-driven programming is the basis of UI development, game development, and most of the web.

**Conditions** — `if this, do that`. Programs make decisions. Nesting conditions to handle multiple cases is where logic starts to get interesting.

**Loops** — `repeat`, `forever`, `repeat until`. The difference between them matters. A `forever` loop runs until the program stops. A `repeat until` loop runs until a condition becomes true. Knowing which to use is design judgment.

**Variables** — programs need memory. Score, position, name, state. Variables are named containers. How you name them and when you update them is already software design.

**Abstraction** — the most important concept. Once `drawHouse` exists as a custom block, you never think about its internals again. You just call it. Hiding complexity behind a name is what makes large programs manageable.

## Things That Actually Stuck

Abstraction is not just a CS concept. It's how you manage complexity in anything. When you name something, you stop having to think about its parts every time you use it.

Events changed how I think about programs. Before this course I thought of code as a recipe — step 1, step 2, step 3. Events showed me that most real programs are more like waiting staff: they sit ready and respond when something happens.
