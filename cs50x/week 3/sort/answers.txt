sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:

reversed50000.txt -> 5.869s
sorted50000.txt -> 1.486s

Sort1 was much slower on the reversed file but faster on the sorted file, which is typical for an unoptimized bubble sort. Its performance depends on input order, confirming it is bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?:

reversed50000.txt -> 1.434s
sorted50000.txt -> 1.185s

Sort2 was fast on both reversed and sorted inputs. This matches merge sort’s O(n log n) behavior, which efficiently handles large lists regardless of input order.

---
sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?:

reversed50000.txt -> 3.363s
sorted50000.txt -> 4.048s

Sort3 was the slowest or among the slowest on both types of inputs. Selection sort always scans every element, so this matches its O(n^2) behavior.
