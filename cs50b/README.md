> "Not 'how do I code this', but 'what should we build and why'."

## What This Course Is

CS50B is CS50 from the top down. CS50x teaches you how computers work from the bottom up — memory, pointers, assembly. CS50B skips all of that and goes straight to the decisions: what technology stack should we use, how do we scale this, what does it cost, what are the risks.

Designed for managers, product managers, founders, and decision-makers who work with engineers but aren't engineers themselves. The goal is not to write code — it's to understand technology well enough to make good decisions about it, ask the right questions, and not get misled.

Note: CS50B was retired by Harvard in December 2025. This completion was before retirement.

## Assignments

One written assignment per week, one per topic. Assignments required demonstrating understanding of concepts, not writing code. Graded by staff. Same academic standard as CS50x but applied to business-relevant problems.

## What I Learned

**Computational Thinking** — how to break problems down algorithmically. What an algorithm is and why efficiency matters. The difference between O(n) and O(n²) expressed in plain terms: a search that takes 1 second with 1000 items vs a search that takes 1 million seconds with 1 million items. Abstraction as a tool for managing complexity at scale.

**Programming Languages** — why so many languages exist and what trade-offs they represent. Compiled vs interpreted. Statically vs dynamically typed. Why Python is fast to write but slow to run. Why C is fast to run but slow to write. What "object-oriented" actually means. Why the choice of language for a project is a real business decision with real consequences.

**Internet Technologies** — IP addresses, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, TCP/IP. What happens technically when a user visits your website. What latency is and where it comes from. The difference between a web server and an application server. APIs: what they are, why companies expose them, and what it means to be API-first.

**Web Development** — frontend vs backend. What a database does. MVC architecture at a conceptual level. Why responsive design matters. The difference between a static site and a dynamic one. Why a CMS like WordPress exists and when it's the right choice vs building custom. How a developer estimates the complexity of a feature.

**Technology Stacks** — what a stack actually is: the combination of frontend framework, backend language/framework, database, hosting, and tooling. How to evaluate whether a stack is a good fit for a product. What technical debt is and how stacks accumulate it. Why startups use managed services instead of building infrastructure themselves.

**Cloud Computing** — what AWS, Azure, and GCP actually provide. IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS: the difference between renting a server, renting a platform, and renting software. Horizontal vs vertical scaling. Why the cloud doesn't eliminate downtime. Cost models: on-demand vs reserved capacity. What serverless means and when it makes sense.

## Things That Actually Stuck

The stack is a business decision. Choosing Rails vs Django vs Node isn't just a technical preference — it affects hiring, velocity, scalability, and long-term maintenance costs. Understanding this made it possible to have real conversations with engineers about technology choices instead of just deferring to them.

Scalability is not automatic. "We'll just scale later" is a common and expensive mistake. Understanding the difference between stateless and stateful architecture, between vertical and horizontal scaling, and what a bottleneck actually is — these change how you evaluate product proposals.

Cloud costs compound. What starts as $200/month can become $20,000/month if you're not watching it. Knowing what meters are running and why is the first step to controlling it.
