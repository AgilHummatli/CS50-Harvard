# CS50T — Understanding Technology

**Harvard University / CS50's Understanding Technology**
6 assignments · Certificate awarded 2024

## What This Course Is

Not a programming course. This is for people who use technology every day but can't answer basic questions about it: How does a computer actually work? What happens when you type a URL? What does encryption actually do? Why does my Wi-Fi slow down?

CS50T fills those gaps. 6 lectures, each an hour long, each demystifying one layer of the stack. By the end you stop seeing technology as magic and start seeing it as systems — systems you can reason about, troubleshoot, and make decisions about.

Note: CS50T was retired by Harvard in June 2024. This completion was just before retirement.

## Assignments

One written assignment per week. Each assignment required explaining concepts from the lecture in your own words — no multiple choice, no copy-paste. You had to demonstrate actual understanding. Graded by staff with a strict standard.

## What I Learned

**Hardware** — binary arithmetic as the foundation of everything. Why computers use only 0 and 1, and how those two values represent numbers, letters, colors, instructions. CPU, RAM, storage, GPU — what each component actually does and why the architecture matters. The difference between volatile memory (RAM — gone when power cuts) and non-volatile (SSD/HDD — persists). Why more RAM helps, why more cores doesn't always help.

**Internet** — what actually happens when you type a URL. DNS turns domain names into IP addresses. Your browser sends an HTTP request. Routers pass your data as packets across networks. TCP ensures packets arrive in order and retransmits lost ones. The full chain from browser to server and back, explained step by step. Also: what a port is, what a protocol is, why there are so many of them.

**Multimedia** — how images are stored as grids of RGB pixels. Why JPEG is smaller than PNG (lossy vs lossless compression). How audio is sampled at discrete time intervals. How video is just many images per second, and how compression removes redundant information between frames. Why file formats exist and what they actually contain.

**Security** — how passwords are hashed (not stored in plain text). What salting is and why it matters. What HTTPS actually protects (and what it doesn't). How phishing attacks work and why they're effective. Cookies, sessions, and how websites remember who you are. Two-factor authentication and why it's stronger than passwords alone.

**Web Development** — how HTML defines structure, CSS defines presentation, and JavaScript adds behavior. What a browser does when it gets an HTML file. The difference between frontend (runs in the browser) and backend (runs on the server). What a web server actually is. How requests and responses form the core of the web.

**Programming** — what source code is vs machine code. How a compiler translates one to the other. Why programming languages exist at different levels of abstraction. How algorithms are designed, evaluated, and compared. Introduction to Scratch as a way to see programming logic without syntax.

## Things That Actually Stuck

The internet is just packets. That was the key insight. Your file gets split into pieces, each piece travels a potentially different route, and they reassemble at the destination. TCP is the protocol that makes this reliable. Understanding this made troubleshooting networks feel logical rather than mysterious.

Security is a trade-off, not a toggle. There's no such thing as "secure". There's only "secure enough for this threat model". That framing changed how I think about every security decision.

Compression is about redundancy. JPEG finds patterns in an image and removes what the human eye won't notice. That's not a trick — it's a mathematical insight about what information matters.
